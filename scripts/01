# Write a script which displays only the login,
# UID and Path of each entry of the /etc/passwd file.
#
cat /etc/passwd | grep -v "#" | cut -d: -f1 -f3 -f6 | tr ':' '\t' | column -t
#
# grep -v removes the comments
# cut keeps only the login UID and Path
# tr turns the separating ':' into tabulations
# column -t allign the entries properly
