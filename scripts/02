# Write a script which updates all the package sources,
# then all the packages, and then logs everything in a file named 
# /var/log/update_script.log.
# Create a scheduled task for this script, once per week at 4 AM.
#
# insert in crontab -e
# 0 4 * * 1 /path/to/script/
apt-get  update >> /var/log/update_script.log
apt-get upgrade >> /var/log/update_script.log
#
# man apt-get : "apt-get is the command line tool for handling package"
# update synchronize the package index file from their sources
# upgrade install the newest packages
# crontab -e lets us edit the scheduled task running with cron
# 0 4 * * 1 means the script will run only once per week at 4 AM
# in order: minute | hour | day of month | month | day of week
